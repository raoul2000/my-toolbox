This is a list of possible improvements and changes that could be added to the app... after evaluation.

- [ ] [Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) can be used to replace *Notify*. It has a lot of options
- [ ] Complete Redesign using [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
- [ ] Provide a full text search feature on some view (ctrl+F : opens model, user enter search term and go !)
- [ ] HTML to Markdown : in order to allow documentation access, use a cached markdown version of the doc pages
